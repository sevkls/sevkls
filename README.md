- 👋 Hi, My name is Sevda but you can call me Sev!

- 👀 I am looking to be a future front end developer or a Data Analyst!
That is why I'm currently making some projects on my own on CSS/HTML.

- 🌱 I’m full-time learning to CSS by myself, but as a curious person, I also look at some Codepen.io's projects and test my 
level at CSS Battle. I also have a YouTube Channel where I post how i break levels.

- 💞️ I am just a 21 years old women, looking for a job, finally launch my career as a full-time Front End Developer.

- 📫 If you are interested in my profile, please me on my mail: sevdakeles_69@hotmail.fr.

Thank you for spending your time to see my projects, I have more projects to show to the world, just be ready for it! :)
